### Prerequisites

Ensure **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your system.

### Build and Run Containers

From the root project directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- The backend will be accessible on port 8080.
- The frontend will be accessible on port 3000.

### Stop Containers
